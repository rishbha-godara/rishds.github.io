**Product & Program Manager | Data-driven execution | Cross-functional leadership | Customer outcomes**

I build products and programs that make complex systems work better—for customers, for teams, and for the business.

My background spans product management and technical program management across cloud, SaaS, healthcare, and commerce. I’m drawn to high-impact, cross-functional problems where the path isn’t obvious—adoption gaps, operational friction, scaling challenges, and launches that need sharper execution. I enjoy turning ambiguity into clarity: aligning stakeholders, defining the right metrics, and driving execution from idea to rollout.

What excites me most is working at the intersection of product, technology, and operations—building solutions that improve customer outcomes while making teams more effective.

## Problems I’ve Solved

### 1) Reduced friction in a high-dropoff customer journey  
**(Product Thinking + Customer Empathy)**  
In a customer-facing onboarding/pre-sales flow, users were showing strong intent but dropping off at a key step. I combined funnel analysis with user feedback to identify the real friction points, then partnered across product, engineering, and design to simplify the journey. This work helped improve completion from **0.6% to 6%**, turning a leaky flow into a much stronger conversion path.

### 2) Shipped high-stakes improvements under business pressure  
**(Program Leadership + Cross-Functional Execution)**  
I’ve led cross-functional initiatives where delivery timelines were tied to broader business commitments and multiple teams had competing priorities. In one such case, I focused on clear scope, milestones, risk management, and a tight execution cadence to keep teams aligned and unblock dependencies quickly. The launch improvements contributed to measurable business outcomes, including a **45% reduction in drop-off** and a **40% increase in user adoption** versus the earlier experience.

### 3) Used experimentation and analytics to improve product performance at scale  
**(Systems Thinking + Data-Driven Execution)**  
A large part of my work is building better decision systems—metrics, dashboards, feedback loops, and instrumentation—so teams can prioritize well and move faster. On a high-traffic digital product, I used A/B and multivariate testing to optimize key user journeys (including discovery and conversion touchpoints) for a product serving **250K+ monthly active users**. This improved visibility into what was working, helped prioritize the highest-impact changes, and drove stronger engagement and conversion outcomes.
